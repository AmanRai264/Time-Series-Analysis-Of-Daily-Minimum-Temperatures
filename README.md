# Time Series Analysis of Daily Minimum Temperatures

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing daily minimum temperatures over time using various time series analysis techniques. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data while applying statistical and machine learning methods to make accurate predictions.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform data visualization with line plots, histograms, and seasonal trend analysis.
   - Compute summary statistics to understand data distribution and variability.
2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Break down the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Analyze and interpret each componentâ€™s effect on temperature variation.
