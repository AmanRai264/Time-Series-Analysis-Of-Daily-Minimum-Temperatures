# Time Series Analysis of Daily Minimum Temperatures

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing daily minimum temperatures over time using various time series analysis techniques. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data while applying statistical and machine learning methods to make accurate predictions.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform data visualization with line plots, histograms, and seasonal trend analysis.
   - Compute summary statistics to understand data distribution and variability.
2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Break down the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
   - Analyze and interpret each componentâ€™s effect on temperature variation.
3. **Stationarity Check**:
   - Conduct Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to determine stationarity.
   - Apply transformations (differencing, log transformation) if necessary.
4. **Forecasting Models**:
   - Implement and compare ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing models.
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAPE, and other error metrics.
## Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the analysis:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "TSA Of Daily minimum temperatures.ipynb"
   ```
## Results
- Successfully identified patterns in daily minimum temperature fluctuations.
- Built predictive models for forecasting future temperature values.
- Provided insights into seasonal and trend variations in the dataset.
